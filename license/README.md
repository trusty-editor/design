# Why the MIT license?
I am releasing trusty under the MIT license for several reasons.

* It is simple. The whole thing is just three short paragraphs and a copyright statement.
* It isn't restrictive. By using the MIT license, I am giving my users the freedom to do anything they want with my code, including 
putting their modifications under a different license or even selling it. 
* It covers my butt if things go bad. :P

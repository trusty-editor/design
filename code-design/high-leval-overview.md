# A high leval overview of trusty's code design

At its highest leval, trusty is made out of a trait and two structures, `FrontEnd`, `BackEnd`, and `Editor`

## FrontEnd
The `FrontEnd` is responsible for receiving events from the user, converting them into a member of the `Event` enum, and dispatching them to the `Editor`. It is also responsible for displaying the UI of the editor and prompting the user when necessary. This is a trait that can be implemented by several structures to allow for multiple front ends.

## Backend
The `BackEnd` is responsible for actually opening files into buffers, editing the buffers, and saving them back into files. It never interacts with the user directly, instead notifing the `Editor` when something happens.

## Editor
The `Editor` is responsible for bringing together the front end and the back end together into one text editor. It recieves events from the front end, processes them, and then tells the back end what to do. It is also responsible for telling the front end to show to the user notifications generated by the back end.


These three elements can be combined to create the text editor like so:

```rust
let editor = Editor::new(ConsoleFrontEnd::new(), BackEnd::new());
editor.start();

```

If a different front end is wanted (like a GUI), a different front end could be used:

```rust
let editor = Editor::new(GuiFrontEnd::new(), Backend::new());
```
